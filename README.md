### _Git_ vs. **GitHub**

**Main difference:** _Git_ DOES NOT require **Github**

_What is Git?_

_Git_ is a command line based system which can be used **offline**.  It is more for personal use which doesn't allow for much collaboration.  Users can efficently make and track changes 


**Github** is a cloud based system (**online**) where you are able to store your projects, so that people around the world are able to see & take your work then out their own spin on it. Git allows for a lot of **collaboration**.

## Initial Setup

The first & **MAIN** step for setting uo your Ide is to create a Github account.  You will need a username & password that will be easy to memorize, please don't forget your account details, we will use them later on.

For a better understanding on how to set up your Ide please click [this link](https://github.com/hstatsep/ide50)

We have two different options when we sept up our Ide, these options are Https & SSH. Let's completely ignore Https for now, let's focus on SSH since it's more important to us at the moment. SSH is important because it is makes things much faster & easier to do. Through SSH we don't have to enter our account details when we want to connect our Ide & Github.
